  - calculator2.css
  - calculator.js
  - README.md

## 💻 Features

- 🧊 **Glassmorphism UI** using `box-shadow`, `transparent` background, and soft edges
- 🧮 Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- ⌫ Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) functionality
- ✨ Smooth and modern button interactions
- 🎯 Fully responsive and clean layout

## 🧠 How It Works

- The `input` box displays the expression/output.
- JavaScript tracks button presses using `querySelectorAll` and `forEach` loop.
- Based on the button clicked:
  - `=` evaluates the expression using `eval()`
  - `AC` clears the input
  - `DEL` deletes the last character
  - Other buttons append their value to the expression
